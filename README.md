Rejects you?  She might.  But you can't go  through life trying to avoid getting a broken 
heart. If you do, it'll break from loneliness anyway. So you might as well take a chance.

with that is worse than having a broken heart, believe me.
- A Simple Investigation, Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig)

There  will  be  a  time  when  you will need to remember that,  no  matter how bleak  or
unwinnable a situation, as long as you and your crew remain steadfast in your dedication,
one to another, you are never ever without hope.
- No Win Scenario, Captain Picard (Patrick Stewart)
```
